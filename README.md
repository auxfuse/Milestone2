# Milestone Project 2

## _KeyWord! the Game_
***

### What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?
This milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from the fourth and fifth modules of the Full
Stack Developer Course, Javacript Fundamentals & Interactive Frontend Development, to build a custom mobile-first fully
responsive Vanilla javascript game called "KeyWord!" <img src="assets/img/keywordLogo.png" alt="logo" title="KeyWord! Logo" width="16" height="16">.

### Functionality of Project.
At its core, this project is built using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript to make the individual features of the game
work. The above three programming languages were used in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework to ensure the project 
itself is as responsive as possible for use amongst the current everyday screen device sizes such as, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop.

The used throughout the build was imported into the HTML from Google Fonts and is called <a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bangers&display=swap">'Bangers'</a>,
creating a retro-ish vibe to accompany the overall theme of the Game itself.

This project went outside the original brief as detailed by the course, in the hopes that it would showcase the skills
I have obtained since the last Milestone submission, and is my own custom version of a keyboard typing skills game I
played as a child/young teen, (of which I can only vaguely remember now on our old family HP PC in the early 2000s and
can't remember the name of).
